## About

LoadLink aims to address the high cost of shipping for small and lightweight goods, making it more affordable for both vendors and customers. LoadLink achieves this by connecting travelers who are embarking on journeys with available space to vendors in need of cost-effective shipping solutions. Travelers can carry goods for vendors during their trips, reducing shipping costs significantly.

> `Note`: This project is currently under active development, and additional features and improvements will be added.

### Built with

#### Backend

- Node.js
- Mongoose - The Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB
- Express.js - Lightweight webserver
- Redis - For holding onto JWT tokens and refresh tokens

#### Frontend

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### Architecture

To separate concerns, the application was built with a Clean Architecture. It is divided into Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers and the User Interface which constitute part of the frontend.

**Clean Architecture**: This architecture ensures a clear separation of logic, preventing the mixing of infrastructure and domain code. It enhances maintainability and scalability.

<img width="1586" alt="Frame 8 (1)" src="./diagrams/clean-architecture.png">

**DDD**: DDD divides our application into subdomains, focusing on core concepts and their related concerns, promoting a cohesive codebase for better organization.

#### User Subdomain

The User subdomain focuses on user-related concepts, including authentication, roles, identity, access management, and more. Here are some of the key concepts that will exist within this subdomain at each architectural layer:

- **Domain Layer**:

  - User (Aggregate Root)
  - UserEmail (Value Object)
  - UserCreated (Domain Event)

- **Application Layer**:

  - CreateUserUseCase (Use Case)
  - GetUserByUserName (Use Case)

- **Adapter Layer**:

  - IUserRepo (Repository Interface Adapter)

- **Infrastructure Layer**:
  - MongooseUserRepo (Concrete Implementation using Mongoose)
  - UserDTO (Data Transmission Objects)

#### Shipping Subdomain

The Shipping subdomain is primarily concerned with the process of creating shipments and shipping products. The concepts within this subdomain do not overlap with those in the User subdomain. Here are some key concepts related to the Shipping subdomain:

- **Domain Layer**:

  - Sender (or Vendor)
  - Traveler
  - Shipment
  - Location

- **Application Layer**:

  - CreateShipmentUseCase (Use Case)
  - ShipProductUseCase (Use Case)
  - FindTravelersForShipmentUseCase (Use Case)

- **Adapter Layer**:

  - ISenderRepo (Repository Interface Adapter)
  - ITravelerRepo (Repository Interface Adapter)
  - IShipmentRepo (Repository Interface Adapter)
  - ILocationRepo (Repository Interface Adapter)

- **Infrastructure Layer**:
  - MongooseSenderRepo (Concrete Implementation using Mongoose)
  - MongooseTravelerRepo (Concrete Implementation using Mongoose)
  - MongooseShipmentRepo (Concrete Implementation using Mongoose)
  - MongooseLocationRepo (Concrete Implementation using Mongoose)
